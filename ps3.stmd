a)
**Regression Analysis**

In the regression equation above, I first chose the variables that were 
normalized data sets, when statistically analyzing with histograms. These variables 
consisted of mnthborn, idlnchld, agefm, age, and educ. However, I further
narrowed down my chosen variables from those normalized histograms, after realizing 
that the month the female was born had in no way any effect or relevance on the age 
of the female at first birth. Ideal number of children also followed this explanation. 
For the variable age, we did not want any correlation amongst the x terms, believing
that age and agefm could be in some way related. There were no helpful changes that 
could be made to normalize the histograms of other variables through logarithmic, 
square term, cube root, square root, or inverse transformations. Therefore, under 
the normality assumption for the independent variables, I kept agefm, since the age 
of the woman when she first married can be relevant towards the women's age at first 
birth of a child.
 
It is also to our understanding to account for other variables that may influence
the age of females after their first birth, through binary (dummy) variables
in our model, keeping in mind we must have k-1, where k represents number of 
parameters/variables in the regression model. Hence, I included usemeth, urban,
and educ0. The variable usemeth would help to explain a woman's knowledge, whether 
or not she knew about birth control or had any experience, which was our only variable close enough to
measure sexual activities that may have led to unintentional or intnentional births,
especially for women who gave birth at an early age. 

The explanatory variable ceb was used to account for any information on other children 
born from the woman. This was why I had excluded children and idlnchld throughout
the model, since this dummy variable already accounted for this category 
in my regression model. Furthermore, the variable ceb was influential because in
most cases, a woman with many children would have most likely to have given
birth at an earlier age.

Based on the exogeneity assumption inherent in this model, I wanted the variables 
to be independent from one another and not directly affected or influenced
within the system/regression itself. Therefore, we want to make sure our exogenous
variables are outside factors only. In my regression equation, I used agefm(age at first
marriage) because it is not directly or internally relative to the outcome of
the other variables listed in the regression model. For example, the age a female
first get married does not determine/is determined by the area where she lives,
the number of living children, and whether they have ever used birth control or not. 
Despite the implications where more women in rural areas may tend to marry at an 
earlier age, or that educated women tend to marry later, it is not a clear or 
direct effect on the variables and their causal relationships with agefbrth. 
 
b) 
**Endogeneity**

In my point of view, I hypothesize, given the results from part (a), that the 
variable education (educ/xK) might be endogenous. For starters, education is
affected in some way by each of our explanatory variabels and vice versa included in the model.
One could say that those who live in an urban environment most typically have a
higher education, due to larger population where people are competittive in studies
and jobs, and are challeneged to succeed and continue devloping their lifestyle
and education. 

We can also say there may be better schools, richer families who
can provide personal tutoring at home, better facilities to promote education
and more educated people who are taking good jobs in urban areas. Education is also relevant
to the age a woman was first married. Typically, a woman who is educated would
most likely marry at a later age, wishing to pursue her dream job or make more
money and stabilize her living environment as well as personal lifestyle before
making changes for a new addition to the family with responsibilities to be held.

If women are highly educated, they are most likely to know the effects of birth control,
so it is safe to suggest that a woman who is educated would most liekly be using
birth pills when pursuing sexual activities to avoid potential accidents for a newborn
child for which they would not expect at an early age. We imply they must have at
least some point taken a health class, or interact with other educated people
and often would tend to avoid the mistakes from others that they may have observed.

c) 
**IV Regression**

Considering an IV regression approach to the endogeneity problem where I used one
instrumental variable for xK (yearborn), I tested for the relevancy of the instrumental 
variable and concluded this instrument as a relevant piece to the model. 

	ivregress 2sls agefbrth ceb usemeth agefm urban educ0 (educ = yearborn)
	
	margins, dyex(educ) continuous
	
	estat firststage


	regress educ ceb usemeth agefm urban educ0 yearborn
	
	test yearborn
	
	predict rhat, resid
	
	hist rhat
	
	regress agefbrth educ ceb usemeth agefm urban educ0 rhat
	
	test rhat = 0
	
When comparing the independent variables for the instrumental variables regression 
and the OLS regression, we see a difference in both signs and values of the coefficients.
The coefficients are much larger in the instrumental variable equation, when
we set yearborn as our onlu instrument. We can also see that the variable ceb 
(children still living) became a positive coefficent in the instrumental variable.
All the other vriables for agefm, urban, educ0 simply increased in value, and finally
the constant also chaned signs to a negative value, indicating that in the instrument 
equation, for an uneducated female without any children, no use of birth control, 
single, not living in an urban area, would have a negative result for the age at 
first birth, which seems reasonable. 

Furthermore, we see that when we observe the education variabels coefficient when 
implementing the margins command dyex (educ) continuous, that the dy/ex value
increases from 1.24 to 23.5. The p-vlaue also remains low, less than 0.05.

d) 
**Instrumental Variable**

The first assumption excludes the instrument z, or in our case yearborn from being a 
regressor in the model for y. If y was dependent on both x and z, and y was regressed on x
by itself, then z is being used in the error, so that z will be correlated with
the error. 

The second assumption requires that there is some association between
the instrument and the variable being instrumented. I can be said that education is
relevant to the year the woman was born. Typically people from different generations
have different ways of learning, and there are possibilities that trends for raising
children or the advances of media or technology may have sparked an influence in
lifestyles of some people and familes for that particular year. 

My chosen instrument yearborn meets the requirements for a good instrumental 
variable given the relationships it shares with the other explanatory variables. 
Similar to yearborn and education, when we observe the exogenous variables, the year the woman 
is born can be relevant to how many children she has. 

It is reasonable to conlcude that a woman carries personal beliefs during that geenration
or maybe feels that she would like children to be born a certain year. In terms of urban 
environment, there may have been an economic crisis, storm, or something that may have 
led the woman to give birth at a certain age, where there are most often economic 
challenges that arise in urba areas. For the variable agefm, the year at which the 
woman was born, may very well affect the age at which she was married. 

e)
**Mata Output**

Using mata, I replicated the parameters and standard errors of this model based on
findings in Question 1 (a) and (c).

f) 
**Conduct a test for the endogeneity xK**

The basic test we consider here starts with the observation that if there is endogeneity then 
b[ols] is biased. If we have tested for and identified a useful instrument(s), and 
estimated an IV model, then we have the following hypothesis to test

	ivregress 2sls agefbrth ceb usemeth agefm urban educ0 (educ = yearborn)
	
	estat endogenous
	
	estat firststage

The null hypothesis is that the instrument (yearborn) set is valid and the model is correctly
specified. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and define our instrument
as a valid indicator to use for our model. This is reasonable as we have stated the logical,
economic and general ways the instrument is related, and thorugh the instrumentable 
variable test procedure, this reveals to show that yearbon is a suitable instrument.

g) 
**Instrumenting for education (xK) using more than one instrumental variable**

We would like to be able to test our assumptions to ensure that our candidate 
instrumental variable (yearborn) meets these conditions. If it does not conform 
with these assumptions, our Î²'s will be biased. We will now be using the General
Method of moments IV regression, where we test for 2 instrumental variables. The
second instrument we added to test is children. We would hope that the number of
children living (ceb) would impact the variable children in some relevant way
which is a plausible reason to choose this as a hypothetical instrument.

	ivregress gmm agefbrth ceb usemeth agefm urban educ0 (educ= yearborn children)

	margins, dyex(educ) continuous

h) 
**Test the endogeneity of xK**
	
	estat endogenous
	
	estat firststage
	
In this new model, with a low p-value, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude
that education is clearly an endogenous variable for our gmm ivregression. Therefore,
we can now compare in our analysis to see how educaiton plays its role as an endogenous
variable in the regression.  

i) 
**Test for overidentification**
	
The intuition the overidentificattion test is dependent on the information 
within the error from the 2sls regression. If the errors can be explained well 
using information in our IV's, then they are not good instruments, since we need 
them to be uncorrelated with the error. The Sargan approach jointly tests 
whether overidentification poses a problem. If it is problematic, we attempt 
using a subset of IV's or look for new ones.

	estat overid

We find that as a result of our overidentificaion test, the joint/multiple 
Instrumental Variable model is strong and relevant (yearborn and children)
and not overidentified.


j) 
**Rationale for using more than 1 instrument for education**

We maintain the assumption that E(z'h($\epsilon$)) = 0, where z and zh are of dimensions
N*K + M and N*1.

We consider the condition (E(z'($\epsilon$) = 0) and the implication for our IV 
estimator z'e^(iv) = 0.

z is the dimension Z x(K + (M - 1)), whereas e^iv is (N x 1). The product is of dimension
(K + M - 1) * 1. But with only K parameters to estimate, we have more equations
than the unkonwns. Therefore we tested for relevance, strength, and overidentification
in IV regression. 

The intuition of this test is dependent on the information contained in the 
error from 2sls regression. If these errors can be explained using information 
in our IV's, then they really aren't good instruments, since we need them to be 
uncorrelated with the error. From my case, it was found that yearborn and children
were relevant and strong instruments as they did pass the overidentification test.
We still want to acknowledge that there may be concerns regarding the exclusion
restriction as well as endogeneity as a problem.

k) 
**GMM and 2sls**

In general, using 2SLS with appropriately robust inference is sufficient, 
and is less of a black box (what goes on within the the mind is ignored, 
in favor of discovering which inputs produce the desired output). 
GMM is oftne used when you are trying to gain efficiency due to neglected serial 
correlation and/or heteroskedasticity. It can also be used with multiple equations 
to efficiency use information across equations.

In terms of the ivregress gmm model, the use of Two-Stage Least Squares over 
Generalized Method of Moments, we can see some changes in comparison. We see that
the variable educ still remains as an endogenous variable for the two instruments
from the regression. The dy/ex value for education is valued at 21.514 which is
lower than the 2sls regression for educ as endogenous variable when only testing
one instrument yearborn. Overall, 2sls regression can be computed in two-stages
but cannot generalize to nonlinear models.
